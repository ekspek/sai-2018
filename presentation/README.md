# Sistemas Electrónicos de Guerra Aérea

### 1. Ataque Electrónico (Electronic Attack (EA/ECM))

Electronic Attack (EA) (previously known as Electronic Counter Measures (ECM)) involves the offensive use of EM energy, directed energy, or anti-radiation weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying enemy combat capability including human life. In the case of EM energy, this action is most commonly referred to as jamming and can be performed on communications systems or radar systems. In the case of anti-radiation weapons, many times this includes missiles or bombs that can home in on a specific signal (radio or radar) and follow that path directly to impact, thus destroying the system broadcasting.

* Jamming (tipos?)
* Electronic “homing” (detectar feixes de radar/telecomunicações inimigos e usar os mesmos para direccionar misseis)

### 2. Protecção Electrónica (Electronic Protection (EP/ECCM)
Electronic Protection (EP) (previously known as Electronic Protective Measures (EPM) or Electronic Counter-CounterMeasures (ECCM)) involves actions taken to protect friendly forces (personnel, facilities, and equipment) from any effects of friendly or enemy use of the electromagnetic spectrum that degrade, neutralize, or destroy friendly combat capability (EA). So, EP brings with it the ability to defeat EA. Not to confuse the issue, but "jamming" is not part of EP, it is the target of EP. Jamming is an EA capability (see above).

* ECM detection
* Pulse compression by "chirping"

* Radiation homing

### 3. Suporte de guerra aérea (Electronic Warfare Support (ES))

Electronic Warfare Support (ES) is a subdivision of EW involving actions taken by an operational commander or operator to detect, intercept, identify, locate, and/or localize sources of intended and unintended radiated electromagnetic (EM) energy. This is often referred to as simply reconnaissance, although today, more common terms are Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) or Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). The purpose is to provide immediate recognition, prioritization, and targeting of threats to battlefield commanders.
